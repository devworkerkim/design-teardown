# Design Teardown

This is the repo for the Design Teardown project in the HTML And CSS course of The Odin Project.  The project was to create a grayscale heatmap for the Smashing Magazine's webpage design.  The grayscale is a reflection of how weighted the design layout is to the eye.  Additional work in the project included using typography for a website.
