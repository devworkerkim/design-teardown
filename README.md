# Design Teardown

This is the repo for the Design Teardown project in the HTML And CSS course of The Odin Project.  The project was to create a grayscale heatmap for the Smashing Magazine's webpage design.  The grayscale is a reflection of how weighted the design layout is to the eye.  Additional work in the project included using typography for a website.

## What I Learned

### Visual Heirarchy

Visual heiracrchy is about how the eyes track on a given page and what elements draw the most attention.  There are a lot of other finer details about user experience, but one that carries a lot of weight is visual heirarchy.  As someone looks at a page, it is important to want a user to immediately draw attention to the important information.  Things like colors, animations, font styles, and other visual properties are important to drawing attention to the most important information.

### Font Face vs. Typography

Font face is the visualization of the text that one sees.  Typography is the science behind the fonts, the visual properties of each font that make up each font.

### `font-weight`

Font weight is the thickness of the font face.  As the font weight increases, the font's strokes become thicker.  Not all font faces have different weights available, and the browser will default the font face to the next available font weight if a value is given that isn't available.
